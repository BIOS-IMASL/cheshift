CheShift
========

CheShift (pronounced /tʃeʃɪft/) is a software for prediction of  13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts and validation of proteins structures. This repository contains a PyMOL plugin to run CheShift. The plugin is an stand alone version of [CheShift-2](http://cheshift.com) Web Server.  For more information of the features of the plugin and how to install and use it please read the CheShift-plugin entry at the [PyMOL Wiki](http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/Cheshift).

CheShift uses [data](https://github.com/aloctavodia/cheshift/tree/master/cheshift/TRIPLE_5) derived from the [Neighbor-Dependent Ramachandran Distributions](http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/ndrd/) obtained by the Dunbrack Lab. This derived data is also released under the GPL license, with the permission of Professor Roland Dunbrack. The full NDRD data is released using a different [license](http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/ndrd/license/index.html).
