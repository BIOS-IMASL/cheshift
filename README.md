========

CheShift is a software for prediction of  13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts and validation of proteins structures. This repository contains a PyMOL plugin that is an stand alone version of the [Web Server](http://cheshift.com). This plugin is usable but **still under testing**. For more information of the features of the plugin and how to install and use it please read the CheShift-plugin entry at the [PyMOL Wiki](http://www.pymolwiki.org:8888/index.php/Cheshift)
